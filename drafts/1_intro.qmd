## TL;DR
This  is blog motivated by [fastai](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson2.html) course.
During a series of posts we will explore how to use deep learning for visual navigation of UAVs.
also we'll touch on some theoretical aspects of deep learning.

The main idea of this blog is to learn by trying to explain the material to others.

Stay tuned!
